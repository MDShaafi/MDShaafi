# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohamed Shaafi, a passionate cybersecurity student and a CTF (Capture The Flag) enthusiast on a journey to become an ethical hacker or a security analyst. ðŸš€

## About Me 
I am deeply fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and the challenges it presents. My goal is to contribute to the ever-evolving field of information security and help make the digital world a safer place for everyone. Currently, I am sharpening my CTF skills by actively participating in numerous Capture The Flag competitions.

## What is CTF?
Capture The Flag (CTF) is an exciting and engaging cybersecurity competition that allows participants to solve a variety of challenges related to cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, forensics, and more. By participating in CTFs, I get hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, and developing creative solutions to secure systems.

## My Journey
I believe that continuous learning is the key to success in cybersecurity. Every day, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and honing my skills through various resources, online courses, and practical exercises. By staying up-to-date with the latest security techniques and technologies, I aim to become a well-rounded professional in the field.
